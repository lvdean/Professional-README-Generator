## Description
The purpose of this challange was to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package.

This was enjoyable task as I could see how this README generator would be beneficial to myself. I was able to create the questions using my personal experience of writing README and with the aid of the acceptance criteria.

## Tasks
* Create prompts for information about my application repository when a command-line application that accepts user input
 * Generate a high-quality, professional README.md with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
 * When I enter my project title this is displayed as the title of the README
* When I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions. This information is added to the sections of the README.
* When I choose a license for my application from a list of options, a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under.
* When I enter my GitHub username, this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
* When I enter my email address, this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions.
* When I click on the links in the Table of Contents,  I am taken to the corresponding section of the README.
